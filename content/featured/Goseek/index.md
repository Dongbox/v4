[GOSEEK challenge](https://github.com/MIT-TESSE/goseek-challenge), which is run in conjunction with the Perception, Action, Learning Workshop at ICRA 2020.
As a paticipanter, we focus on the RL/search aspect to navigate an agent through an office environment to collect randomly-spawned fruit as quickly as possible.
